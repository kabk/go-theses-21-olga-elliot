          This thesis explores the production, erasure, and retrieval of cultural heritage, in the context of the Danish
          colonization of Greenland. Throughout history, mechanisms of worship and negation have been used to marginalize
          and demonize, and we discover that Christianity played a crucial role in the invasion of Greenland and the
          subsequent exploitation of the land and its people. I approach the tradition of Inuit storytelling,
          knowledge-production and spirituality to decenter euro- and anthropocentric perspectives which up until now have
          functioned to prevent Greenlandic sovereignty and survival. I propose <i>the mermaid</i> as a tool for
          critically engaging with the dominant narratives and giving voice to decolonial resistance.

          Using diverse sources such as photographs, documentaries, archival documents, maps, film, literature,
          interviews, and social media posts I create qualitative research. Departing from the neighbourhood where I
          grew up, I examine colonial history through a feminist lens to understand decolonizing currents which
          exceed national borders.

          <i>land of the Kalaallit</i>, referring to the biggest ethnographical group of Inuit (sing. Inuk), historically
          inhabiting Western Greenland. Thus Inuit Nunaat would be a more inclusive alternative as Inuit is composed of
          all the Indigenous peoples of Greenland, however the name would perhaps not include Greenlanders of European descent nor
          the Danish-Greenlanders who account for appr. 10 percent of the population.<a href="#intro-1" class="numbers" id="intro1">1</a> Worth noting is that some find that the noun-form <i>grønlænder</i> (Greenlander in Danish) has gained negative
          connotations, as it is used in a stigmatizing or derogatory way associating Greenlanders with alcoholism,

          <p class="caption">POLICE inspecting The Little Mermaid Copenhagen after her first beheading in 1964. The
            perpetrators have still not been identified and the action remains a mystery.
          <p>
        </div>
        </p>
        At the harbour of Copenhagen, on a large stone by the quay, is a statue of a small womanly figure. She does not
        look like much, but she is world-famous and if you saw her before the pandemic, chances are she was surrounded by
        people from across the world photographing her. For more than a century, she has been sitting still looking at the
        water, her fishtail folded behind her, and her human upper body resting on her arm. Conceived by the Danish author
        H.C. Andersen, <i>the Little Mermaid</i> of the fairytale becomes a human being by giving up her beautiful voice,
        so she can live with the prince whom she loves. Failing to seduce him without words, she is left with only two
        options; either kill him in his sleep, or sacrifice her own life.<i> The Little Mermaid</i> chooses suicide over
        hurting her beloved, yet the story does not end in tragedy as her innocent selflessness is awarded with a chance
        to perform good deeds and finally rise up to the heavens. <div class="note" style="float: right; padding: 30px 0px 10px 25px;">1&nbsp;&nbsp;In spring 2010 she was exhibited in the Danish pavilion during the <i>World Expo</i> in Shanghai.
        Chinese artist Ai Wei Wei kindly supplied Copenhagners with a live-stream of the Little Mermaid in her new
        surroundings, until she returned six months later.</div>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>The Little Mermaid</i> in Denmark has had many visitors and travelled around the world, twice she has been decapitated, and yet she
          always comes back to life.<a href="#chp1-1" class="numbers" id="1-ref">1</a> Is it magic? Is it capitalism? Is it because she gained an immortal soul when she
          struck a deal with the evil sea-witch? Whenever an unsolved issue needs new attention, she is first to revive
          the discussions. Known to resist mainstream opinion, she often appears in scandalous outfits, with bold words or
          accessories, to challenge the Danish self-perception, or show solidarity with victims of oppression in other
          parts of the world. Having been assaulted and dismembered on several occasions, it seems this mermaid with
          nothing left to lose, has become a popular tool for igniting risky conversations on Danish territories.

          Leaving the <i>Little Mermaid</i> for a moment, let us look at her from the other side of the water, by crossing
          the harbour to Christianshavn, taking the first bridge we arrive at the Royal Greenland Dock. From 1750 until
          1970 everything Denmark took from Greenland was shipped to this place and turned into profit.<a href="#chp1-2" class="numbers" id="2-ref">2</a> Also the first Inuit to arrive in Denmark, abducted from Southwestern Greenland in 1605, were sailed here where the Danish king Christian IV himself came
          aboard the “Red Lion” to see them with his own eyes. Enjoying what he saw, he sent many more expeditions to the
          island where over and over Indigenous men,<div class="note" style="float: right; padding: 20px 0px 0px 25px;">3&nbsp;&nbsp;Johannsen, <i>Jagtspyd Sladrer.</i></div> women and children were kidnapped and brought to Copenhagen to demonstrate conquest, stir exotic curiosity and create stories.<a href="#chp1-3" class="numbers" id="3-ref">3</a>

        This show and subsequent displays of non-white peoples in the Zoo garden, made colonization stories all the more

          and K. Wayne Yang <div class="note" style="float: right; padding: 20px 0px 0px 25px;">5&nbsp;&nbsp;Tuck and Yang, <i>Decolonization Is Not a Metaphor,</i> 6.</div> explains this dichotomy:<span class="quote">&nbsp;“Indigenous peoples are those who have creation stories, not

          but transformed into a Goddess when drowning at sea. Refusing to marry any man from her village, her father cuts
          off her fingers as she hangs grasped on to the side of his boat. As she sinks to the dark depths of the sea, her
          fingers turn into sea animals, and as ruler of the underworld, <i>Mother of the Sea</i> holds
          power over both life and afterlife.

        <p>
          This subversive goddess does not dissolve into foam on the waves and become a daughter of the air, and unlike
          the <i>Little Mermaid</i> she would never agree to get her tongue cut off, but was dismembered unwillingly. She
          releases sea animals for the hunters if people on land do not cross her, and <i>angakkut</i> <a href="#chp1-8" class="numbers" id="8-ref">8</a> will risk their life to comb her

              head so high that it seemed to be higher than the crow’s nest on the mainmast. (...) Later the sailors saw
              its tail as well. The monster was longer than our whole ship.”</span><a href="#chp1-10" class="numbers" id="10-ref">10</a>

          This became one of the earliest written accounts of a sea monster sighting. Though intimidated by the
          supernatural encounter, Egede prevailed on his mission to spread the word of God, and even after many generations, Danes still teach Greenlandic people to assimilate and insist that Inuit critical
          thinking, spirituality and creativity does not belong in the classroom. When Panninguaq is cast in the leading
          role as <i>Mother of the Sea</i> in the school musical at College of Nuuk she is disappointed to find out that
          her character will be performing exclusively in Danish and singing the song <i>‘Look At What You Made Me Do’</i> by
          Taylor Swift instead of a Greenlandic song paying tribute to her cultural heritage. She confronts her teacher and proposes to add Greenlandic
          expressions to the script, but her concerns are dismissed so she decides to give up the role.<a href="#chp1-11" class="numbers" id="11-ref">11</a> Not only do

          Was the docile <i>Little Mermaid</i> invented by a Danish man, in an attempt to combat the ferocious sea-goddess
          of Inuit myth? Endorsed by Disney, the <i>Little Mermaid</i> taught me and millions of girls to give up their
          voices and identities for the love of a white man. Rather than roaming the sea, proud of her fish tail, the
          <i>Little Mermaid</i> leaves her sisterhood behind to become ‘fully’ human hoping to live happily ever after
          with a prince. Back in the 18th century Christianshavn, similar hopes must have been held by the women who
          journeyed to Greenland from the ‘discipline, health, and improvement house’ a penal institution hosting
          prostitutes and children. As the new colony which Egede named ‘Good Hope’ (Godthaab) needed females to successfully
          reproduce, these young women and girls got married to the soldiers, prisoners and slaves who the king sent to occupy the
          ‘Island of Hope’ but eventually left to die from malnutrition, and infections.

Apart from a recent attack covering the statue, with red

          celebration of the Danish colonization of Greenland.<a href="#chp1-12" class="numbers" id="12-ref">12</a> Instead the focus is to commemorate the <i>meeting of cultures</i> enforcing the colonial
            narrative of a happy union between the primitive and the civilized, which made Danish territory 98% larger
            than it was. It is this claim to territory that renders Denmark an Arctic superpower and the stolen land
          “natural resources”. Driven by the insatiable desire to explore, extract and exhaust these reserves, Greenlandic
          demands for influence are repeatedly undermined, and the current self-rule act of 2009 does not include foreign
          affairs, finances, defence and jurisdiction.

          The influx of Greenlandic women in Christianshavn today reflects a past of hopelessness. Of the many
          Inuit arriving in Denmark with plans and dreams, those who have their hopes crushed often find community
          in the neighbourhood. Squatters in the 1970’s created a tolerant atmosphere which laid the foundation for the
          biggest drug market in Denmark, in the freetown Christiania. Naturally, the commune has also attracted
          Greenlandic people with addictions and in 2018 during one of countless police raids in Pusher Street, a violent
          confrontation occurred between armed police and civilians. Video recordings of the incident fluctuated,
          depicting an intoxicated and provocative Greenlandic woman being violently pushed back several meters by an
          officer, landing with the back of her head against the brick road.

          It might come as a surprise, that the woman so brutally assaulted two years ago, is still in prison convicted
          for violence against police in function. The 51-year old woman who posed little threat to the officers in full
          armour, was not only wounded, she also had to go two years to prison for it. Following her arrest the newspapers
          did not write about the overrepresentation of Greenlandic women in Danish prisons nor did they write about the systemic
          invisibility Inuit are subjected to due to their Danish passports, instead they found comic relief in her court
          defense:&nbsp;<span class="quote">“I don’t

          with trauma and addiction, many a Greenlandic woman has been racialized, and ostracized by Danish society, only to find peace at the bottom of the bottle, which Danish media dramatize gleefully, thereby
            enforcing dehumanizing stereotypes.

          The harmful effects of this dehumanization have become so unbearably apparent, that when a homeless man was found dying in
          front of a mall, the first by-passer to make an emergency call was asked if the man was ‘a
          Greenlander’. After answering yes, it took 40 minutes and numerous other callers, before an ambulance arrived to
          find the man dead. Even after leaked
            recordings proved how police lied about the racist question, the neglect never had any legal ramifications

          The central <i>Christianshavn's Square</i> is home to young and old alcoholized Greenlanders but also to
          two-billion-year-old Greenlandic marble blocks. The exploitation of land is inextricably linked to that of
          Indigenous peoples, and across generations, patterns emerge demonstrating the urgent need to address the pain
          which Denmark has for centuries inflicted upon Greenland with great indifference. As the desire for independence
          grows stronger, the <i>Little Mermaid</i> could be easily swallowed by the <i>Mother of the Sea</i> who&mdash;as a
          figure of replenishment and regeneration-uses her transformative powers to balance life in the sea, the source
          of Inuit economy. As she releases a new wave of national empowerment, it is yet to be seen whether Greenland will throw all colonial remnants overboard and cut
        ties to the old kingdom-or if her knots can be gently brushed out through Indigenous healing.

          into a constituent part of a nation state 3000 km away. This ongoing somewhat casual exploitation goes largely
          unnoticed and undisputed, yet when Donald Trump in 2019 proposed to <i>buy</i> Greenland, calling it a ‘large
          real-estate deal’, the status of Greenland within the Danish Realm, again became a question of public interest
          in Denmark. Historically the relationship between Greenland and USA, with Denmark paternalistically leading

          Whether it is left to climate scientists or shamans like the angakoq, to guide and foresee the future of our
          environments, it is evident that nature changes behaviour according to human activities. Inuit knew this many
          generations ago, and taboo rules and myths functioned to prevent overhunting, as <i>Mother of the Sea</i> could
          withhold the sea animals if humans violated her territory. As temperatures in the Arctic rise faster than anywhere
          else on the globe, it is easy to imagine the burning fury of <i>Mother of the Sea</i> heating up the ocean due
          to our ignorance and harmful habits.

          Regardless if we decide to think of it as <i>Arctic Amplification</i> or the powers of a furious Goddess, the
          extreme decrease of sea ice opens up new shipping routes in the Arctic, so Asian goods can be transported much
          faster to consumers in the West. Apart from the obvious strategic benefit, Greenland also attracts global
          interest due to its enormous untapped supply of minerals, and rare-earth elements (REE). Estimated to contain a
          third of all the world’s untapped REE reserves alongside the largest undiscovered oil and gas reserves,
          Greenland has been dubbed the
            <i>Amazon of the North</i>.<a href="#chp2-5" class="numbers" id="2-5-ref">5</a> This is a stark comparison given the South-American rainforest is currently

          Changes imposed to Greenlandic ways of living and dying accelerated after World War II, when Greenland changed
          status, becoming an ‘equal’ part of the Danish kingdom in 1953, rather than a colony subjected to UN critique.
          Greenland’s <i>modernization</i> turned self-sufficient hunters into wage-workers in Danish-owned factories
          and mines, and replaced semi-nomadic settlements along the coast, with poor quality concrete blocks in the
          capital, outsourcing care and education from the family to the emerging welfare state. No longer independent in
          small communities, the Greenlandic people became rent-paying and reliant on <div class="note" style="float: right; padding: 0px 0px 10px 25px;">6&nbsp;&nbsp;Federici,<i> On Primitive Accumulation, Globalization and Reproduction.</i></div>forces of the market economy. In

          right to abortion in 1975. Today more pregnancies end in abortion than in birth, and Greenland has one of the
          highest rates of abortion in the world. Paradoxically, the first Greenlandic person to be incarcerated, was a
          woman sentenced in 1909, who committed infaticide after an unwanted pregnancy. Just like the sisters of

            embedded in the social design of the colony, illustrated by the Royal Greenland Trade Department who
            prohibited employees from marrying Inuit or racially mixed women in 1782. The term ‘<i>mixed</i>’ was used to
            describe any Greenlander who, even generations back, had some European ancestry, effectively reducing the 'fully' native population, evoking the <i>blood-quantum
              laws</i> of Northern America. Other than placing Greenlanders in one of two ethnic categories and assessing
            their <i>literacy</i> and <i>moral behaviour</i>, the administrators did everything to quantify the isolated

            Federici brings up the notion of <i>body territory,</i> tying the resistance and defense of land to the female
            body, as the same authorities inflict violence on both. Federici emphasizes how the capitalist state invades
            not only geographical territories but renders the female body a territory, an ‘object of direct
            appropriation’:&nbsp;<span class="quote">“women’s body is a colony that can be acquired, dominated, exploited
              without risk, with impunity.”</span><a href="#chp2-15" class="numbers" id="2-15-ref">15</a> Our understanding of colonization needs to be extended to the
          female body, sexuality, and reproductive rights, if we are to understand how the Danish colonization has
          extended far beyond the date Greenland officially stopped being a colony.<div class="note" style="float: right; padding: 20px 0px 0px 25px;">16&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2015 the ratio of suicides in
            Greenland was 83 per 100.000 which remains more than twice as high as the second and third ranking

          Meanwhile the trauma of forceful modernization has been passed on to following generations and stories of
          neglect, abuse, discrimination and violence are ubiquitous across Inuit territories, leading to a stark rise in
          suicides. Until the year 1950 only 14 suicides had been recorded in Greenland but by the late 1970s the ratio
          had changed <div class="note" style="float: right; padding: 20px 0px 0px 20px;">17&nbsp;&nbsp;Bjerregaard and Larsen, <i>Three Lifestyle-Related Issues of Major Significance for Public

          years in a row, a reality so deeply painful, statistics can only give an indication of the suffering.<a href="#chp2-16" class="numbers" id="2-16-ref">16</a> Violence, alcohol and sexual abuse  is recognized as contributing factors to the suicide
          epidemic, a health survey from 2014
            suggest that almost 50% of East Greenlanders have suffered from sexual abuse while growing up, but surveys
            rarely reflect the historic roots of problems.<a href="#chp2-17" class="numbers" id="2-17-ref">17</a>

            youth suicide:<span class="quote"> “There is an unease, there is a pain, there is a suffering, which is
              permeating through the social body and the body physically, and I think this is an important opportunity. A

          Though the number of suicides peaked in the wake of rapid changes to Greenlandic society, criticism is seldomly
          explicitly directed at the Danish politics which imposed these rapid changes. In the essay ‘Necropolitics’
          political theorist Achille Mbembe defines sovereignty as the right to kill, to subjugate the ‘other’, or in the
          case of suicide the self, to different degrees of death:<span class="quote">&nbsp;“Whether read from the perspective
            of slavery or of colonial occupation, death and freedom are irrevocably interwoven. As we have seen, terror is
            a defining feature of both slave and late-modern colonial regimes. Both regimes are also specific instances
            and experiences of unfreedom. To live under late modern occupation is to experience a permanent condition of
            “being in pain””</span> In this
            experience of unfreedom, the ongoing pain is relieved only at the moment of death, and the sole possibility <div class="note" style="float: left; padding: 20px 25px 0px 0px;">19&nbsp;&nbsp;Mbembé, <i>Necropolitics,</i> 38-39.</div> for
            attaining sovereignty over life is to become one's own killer.<a href="#chp2-19" class="numbers" id="2-19-ref">19</a>

        <p>
          Looking at death as an intrinsic part of politics, and learning that Indigenous and First Nation peoples across
          the globe battle equally brutal statistics, it seems evident that the colonization and still-Danish sovereignty
          is reflected in the <i>pain</i> Greenland faces today. But in Denmark the perception is very different. Mostly
          when Greenland gains media attention, it is for its nature portrayed as a great unexplored <i>resource,</i> or
          for its people portrayed as emotionally dysfunctional addicts, unable to meet <i>modern</i> ways of living.
          Danish film and tv producers will use music and effects to dramatize the vast and beautiful landscapes, in stark
          contrast to the ugliness of Inuit suffering. The awareness that <i>we</i> contribute to that same suffering, has yet to
          sink in, while Denmark continues to postpone or deny attempts of reconciliation.

            has been considered derogatory and was officially replaced by the Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC) in 1980.
            However it can still be found in the<i> National Museum of Denmark </i>as they only recently decided to

            activism.<a href="#chp2-20" class="numbers" id="2-20-ref">20</a> Ignorance has been the preferred attitude towards Greenlandic demands for as long as anyone
          remembers; when an American military plane carrying bombs crashed outside the Thule-base in 1968 Denmark ignored

          Mbembé elaborates on this state of exception, as a consequence of racism, the technology which enabled Europeans
          to commit murder, without it being a crime:&nbsp;<span class="quote">“That colonies might be ruled over in absolute lawlessness stems from
              the racial denial of any common bond between the conqueror and the native. In the eyes of the conqueror,
              savage life is just another form of animal life, a horrifying experience, something alien beyond imagination
              or comprehension. In fact, according to Arendt, what makes the savages different from other human beings is
              less the color of their skin than the fear that they behave like a part of nature, that they treat nature as
              their undisputed master. Nature thus remains, in all its majesty, an overwhelming reality compared to which
              they appear to be phantoms, unreal and ghostlike.”</span><a href="#chp2-22" class="numbers" id="2-22-ref">22</a><div class="note" style="float: left; padding: 20px 25px 0px 0px;">22&nbsp;&nbsp;Mbembé, <i>Necropolitics,</i> 24.</div> Undoubtedly, the lifestyle of Inuit communities was
          used to fuel the fantasy of a vast wilderness, in which 'primitive' <i>savages</i> subordinated to nature in order to
          survive. The colonial imagination of <i>us</i> and <i>them</i> as separate species, justified the difference in
          treatment, present even in ‘postcolonial’ Greenlandic society.

            nothing else) is a form of settler anxiety, <div class="note" style="float: left; padding: 20px 25px 10px 0px;">2&nbsp;&nbsp;Tuck and Yang.<i> Decolonization Is

          taken away focus from the essence of decolonisation. Coined <i>moves to innocence</i>, these responses
          frequently appear in the context of ‘justice-work’ and provide colonizers and their descendants with relief from
          inherent guilt.
        </p>
        <p>
          In response to the vandalism of Hans Egede’s statue, two white scholars wrote the article ‘Activists demand the
          mental decolonisation of the mind’ for Justiceinfo.net. The article begins with a superficial introduction of
          the Danish colonisation of Greenland, after which they quote artist and activist Aqqalu Berthelsen’s statement:&nbsp;<span class="quote"> “It’s about time that we stop celebrating colonizers and that we start taking back what is
            rightfully ours. It is time to decolonize our minds and our country. No colonizer deserves to be on top of a
            mountain like that. We need to learn the Truth of our History,”</span> This straight forward demand is however
          moulded into the settler-friendly idea, that only the minds need decolonisation, without any mention of
          land.

        <p>
          The authors conveniently overlook the most central claim of the statement, that Greenland should be officially
          recognised as its own country. Focusing solely on the diffuse idea of decolonising the mind the article
          describes the activist group as:&nbsp;<span class="quote"> “(...) part of a movement in Greenland calling for mental
            decolonization, who argue that despite large degrees of self-government compared to other indigenous peoples
            around the world, a wide variety of informal forms of colonialism are still governing Greenlandic people,
            making the transition away from the state of Denmark almost impossible.”</span><a href="#chp3-3" class="numbers" id="3-3-ref">3</a> With imprecise reference, they argue Greenland has
        relatively large autonomy, thus instilling skepticism and ignoring the claim for sovereignty,  ultimately appeasing <div class="note" style="float: right; padding: 0px 10px 0px 25px;">3 &nbsp;&nbsp; Krebs and Andersen. <i>Activists

        the white reader, that for Greenland it is <i>almost impossible</i> to leave Denmark. Though perhaps
        well-intended, this argument reveals an underlying conviction that <div class="note" style="float: right; padding: 0px 0px 0px 25px;">4&nbsp;&nbsp;Niviâna,<i> Manifesto: The System Exposing Itself.</i></div> Indigenous people are in need of guidance from
        the white settler state.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tuck and Yang characterizes this form of response as the <i>‘free your mind and the rest will follow’</i>. The central
          mechanism in this specific move to innocence, is to focus on cultivation of critical awareness without regards
          to the necessary actions for actual decolonisation. Another red flag is that, the article makes no mention
          of what was also part of the activist intervention; a red flag with white letters reading ‘LAND BACK’. In the
          activists’ manifesto delivered by Aka Niviâna, the flag is contextualized:&nbsp;<span class="quote">“Land back. A statement not only
          defending the land, but the people living on it. A solidarity movement beyond colonial borders, showing
          solidarity with other indigenous groups and marginalized people.”</span><a href="#chp3-4" class="numbers" id="3-4-ref">4</a>
      Tuck and Yang insist that decolonization must
          include the return of land. That it never goes unnoticed, because it is an unsettling process of distancing the
          settler from that which was unjustly occupied.

          water), and indeed read the word (critical consciousness) in order to write the world (exploit nature). For
          Freire, there are no Natives, no Settlers, and indeed no history, and the future is simply a rupture from the
          timeless present”</span><a href="#chp3-5" class="numbers" id="3-5-ref">5</a> Paradoxically celebrating the colonizer is today normalized to the point that making any

          So Hans Egede remains, after a local vote, at his prominent spot, while the word “DECOLONIZE” has been washed
          off his pedestal. Using the word in its verb-form it becomes an imperative for the continuous dismantling of
          colonial values. It is with this commitment that redesigned curriculums around the globe approach education in a
          myriad of contexts. Research collective Decolonizing Design outlines their vision of improved design education,
          in <i>Decolonising Design Education: Ontologies, Strategies, Urgencies</i> the collective defines decolonisation
          of design as an ontological statement:&nbsp;<span class="quote"> “What we mean by ‘ontological’ is that what we design, designs back on
          us, designing the very being of our world. And it seems for the Global North at least,
          what is required to get viable futures, is to redesign the being-in-our-worlds.”</span><a href="#chp3-7" class="numbers" id="3-7-ref">7</a>

          Like <i>feminism</i> and <i>anti-racism</i> also <i>decolonization</i> can become trendy, but Tuck and

          thinking.” Yet, we have observed a startling number of these discussions make no mention of Indigenous peoples,
          our/their struggles for the recognition of our/their sovereignty, or the contributions of Indigenous
          intellectuals and activists to theories and frameworks of decolonization.”</span><a href="#chp3-8" class="numbers" id="3-8-ref">8</a><div class="note" style="float: left; padding: 20px 25px 0px 0px">8 &nbsp;&nbsp; Tuck and Yang.<i> Decolonization Is Not a Metaphor,</i> 2-3.</div>  This is why at Ontario College of Art

          where Latin is favoured over all other scripts, symptomatically called Non-Latin. Typographer Robert Bringhurst
          defines the responsibility of graphic designers:&nbsp;<span class="quote">“Communication ceases when one being is no different from
          another: when there is nothing strange to wonder at and no new information to exchange. For that reason among

          One surprising example of such offense is the United Nations’ Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
          (UNDRIP). Designed by UN in-house designers, the legal paper uses the same typeface as the <span id="tiki">cocktail menu</span><img src="images/tiki.jpg"> of the
          Vavoom Tiki Room in the Hague, and probably countless other ‘exotic’ publications around the world. Unlike other
          official documents, the headlines are in ‘earthy’ warm colours accompanied by a border consisting of geometric
          spirals. A strong sense of cognitive dissonance occurs when reading the text:<i>“Resolution adopted by the

          However not only ignorant designers are to blame, also our tools carry responsibility as they support these
          decisions. In the 2020 version of Adobe Illustrator, a popular software amongst graphic designers, a property
          called ‘borders’ enables users to apply an ‘Indigenous’ <div class="note" style="float: right; padding: 0px 0px 10px 25px">14&nbsp;&nbsp;Mbembé, <i>Decolonizing Knowledge,</i> 26.</div> style, reminiscent of the UNDRIP spirals. Across
          platforms and interfaces examples of racialization can be found encoded within the software, we see as a neutral
          and universal vessel for design. Indeed, what we design, designs back at us, and as technology grows ‘smarter’
          the question of agency becomes more and more important. Mbembe articulates this development:&nbsp;<span class="quote">“We are witnessing an
          opening up to the multiple affinities between humans and other creatures or species. We can no longer assume
          that there are incommensurable differences between us, tool makers, sign makers, language speakers and other
          animals or between social history and natural history.”</span><a href="#chp3-14" class="numbers" id="3-14-ref">14</a> Without the binary division of objects and subjects,

          In Greenland Inuit storytelling has always played an active role in education and parenting. Many of the central
          myths were told to discipline children, and instill a moral codex to improve the wellbeing of the community.
          Drama, dance and drum-music accompanied rituals and celebrations and the ancestral stories that survived
          colonization, are today listed as UNESCO intangible cultural heritage. In the ‘The Fight for Greenland’

          The inherently female practice of tattooing was one of the first traditions to vanish when the colonial
          introduction of Christianity made all creation stories about Adam and Eve. It is only in recent years that
          the sacred markings have resurfaced as Western beauty ideals prevail beyond the impact of the church.
          Greenlandic tattoo-artist and researcher Maya Sialuk Jacobsen, acknowledges the decolonial significance of the
          traditional practice, but she insists that the tattoos are not revived to be Westernized, commercialized or used
          as a political weapon for Greenlandic independence:<div class="note" style="float: right; padding: 0px 0px 0px 25px">4&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacobsen,<i> Decolonizing Technology: Crafting Indigenous Resistance.</i>

          like it is happening now, and I am eager to change that, because it takes the opportunity away from the whole

          that it works, there is a magic!”</span> Jacobsen describes the craft as something spiritual outside of a commercial
          practice, where a client requests from a catalogue, instead she practices tattooing as a way of healing
          communities. But this Jacobsen is not able to legally perform where she lives in Denmark.

          This is vital work in a context where Indigenous culture is widely understood as belonging to the past.
          Colonization stories position indigeneity as incommensurable with modern life, as something that inevitably had
          to die out as it could not co-exist with civilization. This is why Anishinaabe theorist Gerald Vizenor speaks of
          <i>‘survivance’</i> combining the words <i>survival</i> and <i>resistance</i>:&nbsp;<span class="quote"> “Most importantly, survivance
          establishes Native identity in the present, as opposed to viewing Native experience as a relic of the past,

          narratives in the guise of an alien race (...)”</span><a href="#chp4-9" class="numbers" id="4-9-ref">9</a> Distanced from victimhood, survivance indicates the
          collective experience of existing in spite of an ongoing genocide, most often portrayed as an one-time-event of
          the past. Despite <i>our</i> ceaseless efforts to erase, christen, assimilate, disappear and forget entire populations,
          native researchers and cultural workers inscribe Indigenous lives into cyberspace, public space, and any other space <i>we</i> think of as blank. <div class="note" style="float: right; padding: 20px 0px 0px 25px">9&nbsp;&nbsp;Or<i> endurance</i> in some readings.

          In a globalized world, where every physical and digital corner has been invaded by colonial capitalism, a shared
          resistance against white supremacy provides a different kind of <i>hope</i> than that of Hans Egede. Yet there are very
          specific vocabularies and aesthetics, local to every struggle, that call not just for statements but for particular <i>actions</i>. Just as nuclear waste is a multinational, multi-generational threat to all life, there is a need for
          multi-species thinking in what might be a final chapter of human life on Earth.

          The marble blocks from Maamorilik were buried under the Royal Greenland Dock until it turned tourist-attracting
          food-market. These stories of stones, places and people are deeply intertwined with colonization, but not in the
          dominant narratives which cast Denmark as a benevolent and civilized nation. Most stories, of women like the one
          arrested in Christiania, go untold, because rarely do we listen to how these stories end. The Danish state keeps
          quiet no matter the severity of the suicide crisis in Greenland, and it is hard to imagine just how deep the
          silence is. How long before <i>we</i> see our reflection in <i>their</i> suffering? What hiddem treasures will reveal themselves in
          the colonial soil?

          Perhaps only when Greenland gains full independence, will the Danish prince wake up to find there is no kingdom left.
          Until then, the most urgent task is to minimize our contribution to the <i>ongoing pain.</i> Apologies are far
          from enough, but they are the very first step on the path away from ‘celebrating the colonizers’. No more
          concern should be paid to <i>white fragility</i> as white supremacy is indeed a threat to public health, harming
          those who have been left invisible to systems which deem them ‘unfit’. For inclusive systems to come into existence, designers
          need to dig deep into the terrain they engage with, and realize that creation and destruction goes hand in hand.
          In this context, respectful design is actively questioning existing paradigms, and one's own position and
          privileges within them. It is avoiding stereotypical and racialized aesthetics, and reversing the gaze to
          critically examine our own colonial habits, so that colonized bodies are no longer scrutinized in the eye of
          technology but actively reshaping it. As creative work becomes more precarious and art-history and design canons
          open up to non-conforming knowledges, perhaps survival can be introduced as an academic skill. New curricula
          have the potential to shatter the myth of <i>white innocence</i>, and educate about the toxic forces of “good
          intentions”.<a href="#chp4-14" class="numbers" id="4-14-ref">14</a>

          Greenland should by no means be compared to Denmark, and in positioning the <i>Mother of the Sea</i> in contrast
          to the <i>Little Mermaid</i>, I risk trivializing and confusing struggles which are incommensurable. Women’s
          emancipation does not equal decolonization, anti-racism does not equal decolonization, throwing old statues in
          the harbour does not equal it either&mdash;though it could be a step in that direction, it might also be a slick
          way to get rid of the evidence&mdash;an attempt to escape the discomforting guilt, a move to innocence.

        Despite efforts to make the mermaid an innocent and powerless figure for white consumption, she resurrects at
